Common code for the Relational Databases and Full Stack Fundamentals courses

### Files and commands we’ll be using (Relational Databases)

Files installed for this class are located in the `/vagrant` directory inside the virtual machine. Everything here is automatically shared with the `vagrant` directory inside the `vm` directory on your computer. Any code files you save into that directory from your favorite text editor will be automatically available in the VM.

If you’d like to see what was installed in the VM, look in /vagrant/pg_config.sh.

In this class you will mostly be running your work in Python from the command line. In addition you’ll use the `psql` program to interact with the PostgreSQL database.

To connect `psql` to the forum database for Lesson 3, type `psql forum` at the command line. To exit psql, type `\q` or Control-D (^D).
